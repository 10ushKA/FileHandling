# FileHandling
Provides a simple HTML page where the client can select a local file to upload to the server. 
After sending a request to download a file servlet program will upload the file to a directory on the server, then provide a URL where the user can download the file.
For security reasons the user will not be provided with a direct URL to download the file, instead will be provided with a link to download the file, and servlet will process the request and send the file to the user.

#UPDT
Uploading file to the DB
